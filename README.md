The lack of checksums for addresses can mean that significant amounts of Ether may get sent to random or non-existent accounts. We propose to create a smart contract users can opt in to which allows them to insure against mis-typed addresses whether in the hex format, or as an ENS address.                                                                                                 | [Fork](https://github.com/breaktheblock/cryptinsure)               |         |       | Sponsor team from Accenture          |

| Fire Breathing Rubber Duckies | [My Claim Dossier](https://github.com/CarolineClark/Claim-History-Blockchain/) | There is no way to reliably obtain claim history of a customer at the moment, for insurers this causes problems such as not being able to correctly price a policy. If all claim history is on the blockchain (encrypted), insurers can use that for better pricing. This solution would also help customers switch between insurers, as they will be able to easily prove their claim history and get a good quote. New insurers will be able enter the market as there will be an incentive to switch insurers. | [Fork](https://github.com/breaktheblock/Claim-History-Blockchain/) |         |       | Best Blockchain and Best Concept     |
